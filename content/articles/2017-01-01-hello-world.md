Welcome to my personal repo.  I interact a lot with open source at work, and the things I post here are my
experiences - either with a work-related project, or just for fun.  A lot of what I do can be found through my
work id - [jbostian](https://github.com/jbostian).  My current project is at
[https://izoda.github.io/](https://izoda.github.io/).  

I work a lot with Linux and Python, particularly in the data science arena, so these areas form the
center of gravity for the posts you'll find here.  I hope that some of my experiences are of use to you.

Please interact with me here, or look me up on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/) if you want to know more
about my background.
